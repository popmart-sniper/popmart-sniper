## What Information We Collect (and Why)

This extension collects only your **email address**, and **only** for one purpose:  
To authenticate your login and give you access to your account or subscription.

Authentication may be handled through a third-party service (such as Supabase database), but your email is not used for any other purpose.

We do **not**:

- Collect any other personal information (like your name, address, or location)  
- Track your browsing activity  
- Sell or share your email address with advertisers or third parties

## How Long We Keep Your Data

Your email address is stored **only during your active subscription period**.  
Once your subscription ends, your email is securely deleted or anonymized within a reasonable time frame.

## Links to Other Websites

This extension may include links to third-party websites. Mainly on the popmart domain.
If you choose to visit those sites, their own privacy policies will apply â€” not this one.  
We recommend reviewing their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally.  
If that happens, the "Effective Date" at the top will be revised.  
We encourage you to review the policy from time to time to stay informed.
